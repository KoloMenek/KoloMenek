# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there 
My name is Kamil and I am a french Engineer (eq. Master in Science degree) in the Computer Science field. 

# ðŸ“« How to reach me
If you want to contact me or know more about me, you can check my profile on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kamil-marut/).

# ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my personal website   
Currently, I am working on my own personal website. I would like this website to have multiple funtionalities. A way for people to contact me using a contact form, a home page with a description of myself and the website, a Curriculu Vitae page with my CV in PDF format and a project page where I display different projects I worked on.

# ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity is a very interesting domain to me. As a student, I joined my school's cybersecurity student association, learned the basics of cybersecurity and participated to few CTF events. I know I am nowhere near the required level to work in this domain. This is why I am currently working on improving my skills and preparing different certifications so I can work in this domain in the future.


# ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my projects
When looking on my GitHub profile, there are very few public repositories. I worked on many personal and private projects including CTF writeups, programs and other projects. I would be happy to talk about them privately but these projects are not ready to become public.
